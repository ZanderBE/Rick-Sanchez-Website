            Rick Sanchez is the co-eponymous main character and leading protagonist of the show.

          Pickle Rick is a version of Rick Sanchez first seen in a teaser for Season 3 of Rick and Morty. His only functional body parts are his eyes and a mouth. This situation forces him to create gruesome means of transportation.<sup><a href="http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Pickle_Rick_(character)">[3*]</a></sup></p>
